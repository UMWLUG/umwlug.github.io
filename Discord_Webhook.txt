UMW LUG

I've created a discord server for us to use for announcements and discussions. 
I've made a webhook that sends a discord message in the #Announcements channel whenever the github is updated.
Admins of this server and any others, the guide at https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045093012
was quite helpful. Please use this for #github-announcements as needed.
